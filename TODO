inactivity
  For a single watcher, a simple timeout would surely have the same
  effect. But if there would be a watcher grouping feature (as you
  indicated), watching groups of watchers could provide a new dimension
  of flexibility.

add timeout for var watchers?

mjtg@cus.cam.ac.uk signal discussion:
  The API rsignal overrides the current signal handler.  If the signal
  watcher is cancelled (or otherwise disabled) then rsignal is reset to
  SIG_DFL.  Maybe the original handler
  should be restored.  On the other hand, assignment to %SIG will mess
  up Event watchers so maybe Event should refuse to watch a signal if a
  handler is already installed.

there seems to be some sort of bug in the shutdown phase

If I install a watcher and delay the call of loop(), what about
events arriving in the meantime?
