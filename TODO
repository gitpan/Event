Not with me:
 
Adding a non-CORE module to Tk's dependancies will make it harder to install,
so Tk would like Event::* in the core. It is not in the core of 5.004.
Also I suspect we need speed and space clean Event. If 5.005+'s features
assist that use them.
 
Finally it has been shown people only upgrade when the new version has  
features they need (or lacks bugs they don't need), Event could be such  
a feature.
