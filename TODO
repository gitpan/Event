  how to design new event types (in C)??

mjtg@cus.cam.ac.uk signal discussion:
  The API rsignal overrides the current signal handler.  If the signal
  watcher is cancelled (or otherwise disabled) then rsignal is reset to
  SIG_DFL.  Maybe the original handler
  should be restored.  On the other hand, assignment to %SIG will mess
  up Event watchers so maybe Event should refuse to watch a signal if a
  handler is already installed.
