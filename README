=head1 R!CENT CHANGES


** 1998-09-04 RELEASE 0.10

- Event::TopServer implements a top-style control panel available via
telnet ($$ % 7000).  See util/top.pl.

- Proxy "tied" event type that allows completely perl-side
implementation of new event handlers.

- Event::process is working again (implementation is entirely in
perl).

- Eliminated race conditions in signal handling.

- Zombie events are still not being collected due to mysterious refcnt
problems.  It is possible that this cannot be resolved until perl
implements tied hashes properly (through a VTBL!).

- Removed $Event::*::Count since it is superceded by Event::TopServer.

- Fixed a bunch of minor bugs.
