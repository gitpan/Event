A Perl Event Loop


While embedding an Apache server is one solution, such extreme
measures are not always necessary or desirable.  This module aims to
provide an simple and fast Event loop for a broad subset of
applications.

The design and implementation of this extension is discussed on the
perl-loop mailing list.  Please send email to majordomo@perl.org to
