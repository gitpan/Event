A Perl Event Loop


While embedding an Apache server is an extreme solution, such measures
are not always necessary or desirable.  This module aims to provide an
simple and fast Event loop for a broad subset of applications.

The design and implementation of this extension is discussed on the
perl-loop mailing list.  Please send email to majordomo@perl.org to
subscribe!


Once you successfully build this extension, please run
./util/bench.pl.

Thanks.
