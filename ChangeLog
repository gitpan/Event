1999-03-03  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Make io timers non-repeating.

	* Relax io watchers more.  Now they can be started with either
 	e_fd or e_timeout or both or neither.

1999-03-02  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Allow creation of io watchers without a valid e_fd.  Should
 	probably do the same with the rest of the watcher types.

	* Added e_suspend.  Do we keep the 'suspend' and 'resume' methods?

1999-02-26  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

 	test.

1999-02-25  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Constructors now populate the watcher hash with any extra
	unrecognized key-value pairs.

1999-02-01  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Better typemap diagnostics.  There seem to be bugs lurking but I
 	can't construct a short test case...

1999-01-19  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Arrange for events to have the same careful typemap treatment as
 	do watchers.  Added test.

1999-01-12  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Release 0.29.

	* Unplugged Time::Virtual (suggested mainly by Sarathy, Nick and
 	Graham).  See patches/time-hires.

1998-12-30  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Added AllWatchers & typemap functions to the public API.

	* Moved Event::Stats to a separate tarball.  I wonder if the stats
 	API is too restrictive?

1998-12-28  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Split Event::Watcher code into a separate file for intuitive
 	importing via 'use' (suggested by artur@vogon-solutions.com).

	* Fix SEGV in keys %$event (ophir@internap.com &
 	artur@vogon-solutions.com).  Added test.

	* Tweaks to diagnostics.

1998-12-27  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Release 0.28.

	* Event destruction now must be managed explicitly.  Use the
 	'stop' method to disable a watcher and use 'cancel' to destroy a
 	watcher.  This change is an unfortunate necessity because of
 	optimizations in perl's reference counting.

	* Suspend & cancel now abort any pending events.  In previous
 	releases, the callback could be called after cancel in some cases.

1998-12-25  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Release 0.27.

	* Replaced newHVhv.  Some versions of perl have a buggy
 	implementation.

	* Fixed a few minor problems detected by Insure++.

1998-12-24  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Fixed typos in croak messages.

	* Generous updates to Event.pod.

	* Bumped version to 0.26.  Merry Christmas!!
	
	* Renamed (lots of) keys.

	* Added 'use_keys' method.  Comments?
	
	* (Try to) remove support for leading dashes (any left?).

	* Factor out code to Time::Virtual (& Time::HiRes).

1998-12-19  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Moved process.pm to demo directory.

1998-12-08  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Added discussion of event loops vs. threads
 	(kudos to Mark.Mielke.markm@nt.com & fellow loop'ers).

1998-11-20  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Release 0.25.

1998-11-19  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Move SAVETMPS/FREETMPS up to Event::_loop.

1998-11-13  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Split ACTIVE flag into two separate flags, ACTIVE & POLLING, to
 	more accurately track watcher state.

1998-11-09  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Tweaks to io 'events' mask handling.

	* Move @EXPORT_OK list for qw(R W E T) to Event::Watcher.

1998-11-06  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Fix SEGV in all_watchers/all_idle if zero watchers present.

1998-11-04  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Nuke obsolete backward support code in io.c.  (Poll constants to
 	set event mask.)

	* Rename event_vtbl->watcher.

1998-11-01  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Release 0.24.  [Massive code changes -- caution advised!]

	* Reengineered hash-object implementation to use HVs.

1998-10-31  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Removed tailpoll support from io watchers.  File::Tail can just
 	hook up with timers & a generic "block on read" API can be built
 	on top of that if need arises.  Nick, this okay?

	* Split watchers & events into separate C structures.

1998-10-24  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Fixed misbehaving autoload code.

	* END hook to cancel all events before global destruction.  Still
 	needs more work to be sure the memory is freed.

	* Fixed bad arithmetic in io timeout code.  Renamed interval
 	epsilon and added better diagnostics (see Event::_timeout_too_early).

1998-10-20  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Timers cancelled within their callback weren't!  Fixed.

1998-10-19  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Fix typo in c/queue.c (thanks again Jan!).

1998-10-18  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Release 0.23.

	* Unified Perl & C API for hooks.

	* Niggles for Win32 (thanks Jan!).

1998-10-17  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Release 0.22.

	* Include copy of self-tie patch with dist.

	* Documentation for Event::MakeMaker.

	* tailpoll revamped.

	* MIN_PERL_DEFINE clean.

1998-10-15  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Improve sv_2interval typemap.

1998-10-08  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Release 0.21.

	* Try to normalize benchmark.

	* 'now' was broken for inactive events.  Fixed & added test.

	* Fixed infinite loop triggered by botched exception recovery.

1998-10-06  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Release 0.20.

	* Rename inactive to inactivity.

	* Use new self-tie to wrap watcher objects.  Leak test now passes
 	for almost all watcher types.

1998-10-04  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Slight improvements to gettimeofday.c.

	* Merged c_callback & perl_callback into one pointer slot.

1998-10-03  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Added timeable methods to the public API.

	* Var watchers weren't working very well.  Set up events/got mask
 	stuff mirroring io watchers.  Added tests.  Does anyone really
 	want timeouts?

	* Release 0.19.

	* Put in code for tailpoll, but I can't tell if it works because
 	the tail-f behavior seems to already happen automatically.
  	Comments?  See demo/tail.t.

	* Added inactive watchers (& tests).

	* timeable API changes to allow multiple timers per watcher.

	* Fixed non-ANSI function declaration in c/signal.c

	* Reduced C API.

	* Renamed queueEvent to queue.

	* Fixed refcnt problem in DELETE.

	* Dashes depreciated.

	* Added -timeout to process watchers.  Might be useful.

	* Fixed typo induced polling in one_event.

	* Moved R/W/E/T flags to Event from Event::io.

	* Changed the arguments to $Event::DIED in order to cope with
 	$Event::DIED dieing.  Fixed sweep exception handling.  Added test.

1998-10-02  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Watchers created with the C API now should require their perl
 	support code automatically.  Moved idle support to an autoloaded
 	pm.

	* Added sweep & loop($timeout).  Fixed sleep.

	* Release 0.18.

	* Added non-working export_fail prototype.  Suggestions welcome.

	* Re-factored start & stop better (the preCB method is gone).

	* Finished up sleep().  Added tests.

	* Tied watchers are now based on pe_tmevent.

1998-10-01  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Applied patch from Gisle for pe_sys_sleep/select.

	* Renamed 'watchvar' to 'var'.

	* Added tests for 'now' (it was completely broken!).

	* Tweaked debug levels.  Someone needs to inventory debug warnings
 	are decide what is reasonable.

	* Release 0.17

	* Added tests.
	
1998-09-30  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Added sleep().  Truly a tortuous experience.
	
	* Added min/max interval to idle watchers.

	* c_callback no longer prevents watcher destruction.  Use refcnt!

	* Renamed various C APIs for accuracy (unix_io.c).
	
	* Reentrant flag added.

1998-09-29  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Release 0.16 (only as a patch)

	* loop() now terminates when there are no active watchers left.

	* Depreciated async.  Moved -priority to -nice & added warning.

	* Fixed minor stuff.
	
	* Make io timeouts work for real.  (Thanks Gisle :-)

	* Release 0.15.

	* Improved the EventAPI.h version check.
	
	* Added -timeout for io watchers.  Untested.

	* Fix io watcher bugs (unix_io.c) pointed out by Gisle Aas.

1998-09-28  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Release 0.14.

	* Gutted the internals to make events reentrant.

	* The $Now cache was not being refreshed and that was causing
 	timers to be queued, well, never.

	* Fixed whitespace in Event.pod.  (Gisle Aas again.)

	* Optimized priority queue (hopefully).  I probably should have
 	benchmarked it first.  :-P

1998-09-27  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Release 0.13.
	
	* Moved and renamed lots of methods.  Yet, added code to ease
 	backward compatibility.  (perl-loop suggested)

1998-09-24  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Integrated rewritten documentation contributed by Gisle
 	Aas. Thanks!

1998-09-21  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Release 0.12.
	
	* Event::MakeMaker & event_api.h.

1998-09-14  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Add 'total' stat.  Moved stat methods to Event::Loop package.

1998-09-11  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Release 0.11.

1998-09-10  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Regularized exception handling.  $Event::DIED is now called if an
 	event dies.

	* Allow timer interval to be a scalar ref.

1998-09-09  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Tweaked queue scheduling.  Events with priorities <= 5 now
 	starve if higher priority events are available.

	* Changing the event priority of a queued event will now reque the
 	event into the appropriate queue.

	* Split NetServer::ProcessTop into it's own tarball.

1998-09-04  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua@eq1062.wks.na.deuba.com>

	* Release 0.10.

	* NetServer::ProcessTop implements a top-style control panel
 	available via telnet ($$ % 7000).  See util/top.pl.

	* Proxy "tied" event type that allows completely perl-side
 	implementation of new event handlers.

	* Event::process is working again (implementation is entirely in
 	perl).

	* Eliminated race conditions in signal handling.

	* Zombie events are still not being collected due to mysterious
 	refcnt problems.  It is possible that this cannot be resolved
 	until perl implements tied hashes properly (through a VTBL!).

	* Removed $Event::*::Count since it is superceded by
 	NetServer::ProcessTop.
	
1998-08-28  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua@eq1062.wks.na.deuba.com>

	* Fixed serious bug in the event destructor.

1998-08-22  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua@eq1062.wks.na.deuba.com>

	* Accept file descriptor numbers in addition to filehandles, etc.
  	Maybe non-portable, but nice for unixen.

1998-08-19  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Fixed repeating timer logic.  Tweaks for idle events.

1998-08-14  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>
 	
	* Completed re-write of almost everything in C.
