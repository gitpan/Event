1998-09-28  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Release 0.14.

	* Gutted the internals to make events reentrant.

	* The $Now cache was not being refreshed and that was causing
 	timers to be queued, well, never.

	* Fixed whitespace in Event.pod.  (Gisle Aas again.)

	* Optimized priority queue (hopefully).

1998-09-27  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Release 0.13.
	
	* Moved and renamed lots of methods.  Yet, added code to ease
 	backward compatibility.  (perl-loop suggested)

1998-09-24  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Integrated rewritten documentation contributed by Gisle
 	Aas. Thanks!

1998-09-21  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Release 0.12.
	
	* Event::MakeMaker & event_api.h.

1998-09-14  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Add 'total' stat.  Moved stat methods to Event::Loop package.

1998-09-11  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Release 0.11.

1998-09-10  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Regularized exception handling.  $Event::DIED is now called if an
 	event dies.

	* Allow timer interval to be a scalar ref.

1998-09-09  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Tweaked queue scheduling.  Events with priorities <= 5 now
 	starve if higher priority events are available.

	* Changing the event priority of a queued event will now reque the
 	event into the appropriate queue.

	* Split NetServer::ProcessTop into it's own tarball.

1998-09-04  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua@eq1062.wks.na.deuba.com>

	* Release 0.10.

	* NetServer::ProcessTop implements a top-style control panel
 	available via telnet ($$ % 7000).  See util/top.pl.

	* Proxy "tied" event type that allows completely perl-side
 	implementation of new event handlers.

	* Event::process is working again (implementation is entirely in
 	perl).

	* Eliminated race conditions in signal handling.

	* Zombie events are still not being collected due to mysterious
 	refcnt problems.  It is possible that this cannot be resolved
 	until perl implements tied hashes properly (through a VTBL!).

	* Removed $Event::*::Count since it is superceded by
 	NetServer::ProcessTop.
	
1998-08-28  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua@eq1062.wks.na.deuba.com>

	* Fixed serious bug in the event destructor.

1998-08-22  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua@eq1062.wks.na.deuba.com>

	* Accept file descriptor numbers in addition to filehandles, etc.
  	Maybe non-portable, but nice for unixen.

1998-08-19  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>

	* Fixed repeating timer logic.  Tweaks for idle events.

1998-08-14  Joshua Pritikin  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>
 	
	* Completed re-write of almost everything in C.
